    <div class="who">Hey there! You may be wondering who in the world are we and what is OneChef ... Well let us tell you a bit about us! We are a small group of young people who wants to change the online food world, in a way ... We thought - how about making it more connected, let's make one on one time more popular in cooking. So we created OneChef, the first place in the world, where any chef or bartender can put their own masterclasses in and people from around the world can learn from them, in one on one interraction style. <br> For your knowledge, at the moment we are just a student company but we have big plans towards this project and are working on achieving them trough this platform. We are no professionals so please excuse our "not so professional" web design! :) We are working on it! If you have any kinds of advice, then please leave it at "Leave a review" page. It will help us improve a lot! <br> Have a nice day! Cheers, OneChef team!</div>
